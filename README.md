## About Me

### Futuristic
I am inspired by the future and tend to inspire others with their visions of the future. Instinctively, I have the capacity to envision what the coming months or years could, should, or will be like. I am prompted to transform ideas into things I can touch, taste, see, smell, or hear. Being Futuristic allows me to be especially strong in start-up situations because of how I can turn ideas into actions.

### Maximizer
I accept the fact that no two people are the same, thus forcing me to focus on others' individual strengths to stimulate personal and group excellence. I accept the need to build upon my raw talents to create true strengths. I always seek to transfer something strong into something superb. Being a Maximizer allows me to handle management positions because I focus on peoples' strengths rather than weaknesses. 

### Significant 
I am extremely independent and want to be recognized in my field of work. I derive much satisfaction from doing whatver I can to help people prosper and flourish. I boost the spirits of my colleagues by choosing to acknowledge their accomplishments , talents, knowledge, and/or skills. Wanting to be Significant forces me to  be my greatest motivation and always working to the best of my ability. 

### Analytical 
I have the ability to think about all the factors that may affect a situation. I periodically sequence tasks according to their importance before moving into action. Being Analytical allows me to excel in risk management because my mind is always working and producing insightful analysis.  

### Relator
I enjoy having close relationships and find deep satisfaction in working with friends to achieve a goal. I welcome opportunities to spend time with friends and colleagues to think about the future. I often find myself being invited to offer suggestions about what can and cannot be accomplished in the coming months. This strength allows me to creat sufficient bonds with others, allowing me to work well with people. Being a Relator allows me to be see individuals for who they are rather than by a title.
